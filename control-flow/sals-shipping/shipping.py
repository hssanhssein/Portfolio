# In this project, I built a program that takes the weight of a package and determines the cheapest way to ship that package using Salâ€™s Shippers.
# The Python program asks the user for the weight of their package and then tells them which method of shipping is cheapest and how much it will cost to ship their package using Salâ€™s Shippers.

# Sal's Shipping

weight = 80

# Ground Shipping ðŸšš

if weight <= 2:
  cost_ground = weight * 1.5 + 20
elif weight <= 6:
  cost_ground = weight * 3.00 + 20
elif weight <= 10:
  cost_ground = weight * 4.00 + 20
else:
  cost_ground = weight * 4.75 + 20

print("Ground Shipping $", cost_ground)
      
# Ground Shipping Premimum

cost_ground_premium = 125.00

print("Ground Shipping Premimium $", cost_ground_premium)

# Drone Shipping

if weight <= 2:
  cost_drone = weight * 4.5
elif weight <= 6:
  cost_drone = weight * 9.00
elif weight <= 10:
  cost_drone = weight * 12.00
else:
  cost_drone = weight * 14.25

print("Drone Shipping: $", cost_drone)
